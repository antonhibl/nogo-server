# NoGo Server

This is a web server outline I am testing to create a dynamic JSON data driven fullstack web server using GoLang and Node.js to drive dynamic server and client events. I will be using what I learned on my last HTTP server to fully explore some of the more accessible elements of ES6 using Node.js and TypeScript. This is more for personal use than anything else but if anyone would like to use this code just credit me in some form if it will be used commercially, otherwise have at it.
